Call Log Analysis
You are provided with a call log history represented as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the following keys:

name (str): The name of the caller.
duration (int): The duration of the call in seconds.
There will be multiple entries with the same name in the dataset. Implement a function process_call_logs(call_logs, task) where task is one of the following:

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

get_call_counts
Returns a dictionary with caller names as keys and the count of their calls as values.
get_total_call_durations
Returns a dictionary with caller names as keys and the total duration of their calls as values.
most_frequent_caller
Returns the name of the caller with the highest number of calls.
If there is a tie, the name with most call duration is returned.
Example

call_log = [
    {"name": "Alice", "duration": 300},
    {"name": "Bob", "duration": 200},
    {"name": "Alice", "duration": 100},
    {"name": "Bob", "duration": 400},
    {"name": "Charlie", "duration":300}
]
get_call_count - {'Alice':2, 'Bob':2, 'Charlie': 1}
get_total_call_duration - {'Alice': 400, 'Bob': 600, 'Charlie': 300}
most_frequent_caller - 'Bob', (Alice and Bob has same number of calls but Bob has the most duration.)
