Append and Prepend Alternatively
Given a sequence of n strings as input, create a final word by appending and prepending the strings alternately based on their order. Strings at even indices (0-based) are appended to the end, while strings at odd indices are prepended to the beginning.

NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

Input Format
